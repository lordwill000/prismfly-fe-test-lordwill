## 💾 First Install

### 1. Install `pnpm`

Ensure you have `pnpm` installed. If not, get it [here](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### 2. Node.js & npm

Ensure you have Node.js version 20 or higher installed. The recommended way to manage Node.js versions is via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). After setting up `nvm`, install the necessary Node.js version:

```bash
nvm install 20
```


## 🧑‍💻 Development

pnpm run install
```

- Utilised [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for local development server and for building files
